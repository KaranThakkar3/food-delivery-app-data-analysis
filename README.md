# Food Delivery App Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores **merchant data from food delivery apps** through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data visualization techniques. The goal is to gain insights into restaurant distribution, price buckets, promotions, and review ratings across various food delivery platforms.

## Features
- Analyze restaurant distribution by location and price bucket.
- Explore the impact of promotions on customer review ratings.
- Visualize restaurant ratings across different price categories.
- Perform geospatial analysis of restaurant locations.
- Apply clustering techniques to group similar restaurants based on their characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about restaurants available on food delivery apps, such as:
- **Location details**: city, state, ZIP code, latitude, and longitude.
- **Restaurant details**: name, price bucket, review ratings, and review counts.
- **Promotions**: special offers and promotions from restaurants.
- **Images and URLs**: links to restaurant images and pages.

## Tools & Technologies
This project uses the following tech stack:
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data wrangling.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **Folium** for geospatial mapping.
- **scikit-learn** for clustering analysis (optional).
- **Jupyter Notebook** for running the analysis.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and remove duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze restaurant distribution across various locations and price categories.
   - Explore the relationship between promotions and review ratings.
   - Visualize trends in review ratings across different price buckets.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Map the geographic distribution of restaurants using latitude and longitude.
   
5. **Clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to identify groups of similar restaurants.
